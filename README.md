### Introduction

I really do not consider myself much of a programmer/dev type, but Farcaster has done a great job releasing plenty of docs on how to build Frames, which is a new feature of their social graph client, Warpcast. Using these docs, I am going to try to build and post my own frames to see just how easy it is and gain a better understanding of what the potential use cases can be.

Here's the link: https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/what-is-farcaster/frames
